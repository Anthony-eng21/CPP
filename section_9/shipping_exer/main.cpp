/*  PsuedoCode
    Shipping cost calculator

    Ask the user for package dimension in inches
    length, width, height - these should be integers

    All dimension must be 10 inches or less or we cannot ship it

    Base cost $2.50
    If package volume is greater than 100 cubic inches there is a 10% surcharge
    If package volume is greater than 500 cubic inches there is a 25% surcharge
